<h3 style="text-align: center;">GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

<p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 &lt;<a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p><p>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>

<h4><a name="section0"></a>0. Additional Definitions.</h4>

<p>As used herein, &ldquo;this License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the &ldquo;GNU GPL&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Library&rdquo; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>

<p>An &ldquo;Application&rdquo; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;Combined Work&rdquo; is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &ldquo;Linked
Version&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Minimal Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Application Code&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>

<h4><a name="section1"></a>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</h4>

<p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>

<h4><a name="section2"></a>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</h4>

<p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</li>

<li>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="section3"></a>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</h4>

<p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.</li>

<li>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="section4"></a>4. Combined Works.</h4>

<p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.</li>

<li>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.</li>

<li>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</li>

<li>d) Do one of the following:

<ul>
<li>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.</li>

<li>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="section5"></a>5. Combined Libraries.</h4>

<p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.</li>

<li>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="section6"></a>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</h4>

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo;
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.</p>

		<h1>Eclipse Public License  - v 1.0</h1>

<p><font size="2">THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER
THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE,
REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&rsquo;S ACCEPTANCE
OF THIS AGREEMENT.</font></p>

<p><strong><font size="2">1. DEFINITIONS</span></strong></font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Contribution&quot; means:</font> </p>
<blockquote>
<font size="2">
<p>
	a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
	distributed under this Agreement, and<br clear=left>
	b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
</p>
<p>i)changes to the Program, and</span></p>
<p>ii)additions to the Program;</span></p>
<p>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed
by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor
if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on
such Contributor&rsquo;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
works of the Program. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or
entity that distributes the Program.</p>


<p>&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent
claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use
or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. </p>

<p>&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions
distributed in accordance with this Agreement.</p>

<p>&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who
receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors. </p>

<p><strong>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</strong> </p>

<p>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient
a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to<span
style='color:red'> </span>reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code
form.</p>

<p>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,<span style='color:green'> </span>royalty-free
patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import
and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source
code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination
of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added
by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination
to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to
any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder. </p>

<p>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its
Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor
that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example,
if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute
the Program, it is Recipient&rsquo;s responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Program.</p>

<p>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
this Agreement. </p>

<p><strong>3. REQUIREMENTS</span></strong> </p>

<p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the
Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p>

<p>b) its license agreement:</p>

<p>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
and fitness for a particular purpose; </p>

<p>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages,
including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such
as lost profits; </p>

<p>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that
Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p>

<p>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and
informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
medium customarily used for software exchange.</p>
</blockquote>
 
<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and </p>

<p>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program. </p>

<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the
originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. </p>

<p><strong>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</strong></p>

<p>Commercial distributors of software may
accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners
and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the
Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial
Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and
costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other
legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to
the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor
to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and
any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate
in any such claim at its own expense.</p>

<p>For example, a Contributor might include the
Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and
warranties are such Commercial Contributor&rsquo;s responsibility alone. Under this
section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the
other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. </p>

<p><strong>5. NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the
Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this
Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. </p>

<p><strong>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</strong></p>

<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR
ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY
OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF
THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p><strong>7. GENERAL</strong></p>

<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid
or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without
further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>

<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with
other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&rsquo;s patent(s), then such
Recipient&rsquo;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed. </p>

<p>All Recipient&rsquo;s rights under this Agreement
shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or
conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable
period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&rsquo;s
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
Recipient&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by
Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. </p>

<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement
Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has
the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial
Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to
serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version
of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program
(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of
the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated
in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to
the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</p>

<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the
State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of
America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. </p><br/>
